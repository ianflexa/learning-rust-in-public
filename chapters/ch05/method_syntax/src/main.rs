// ***** notes *****
/*
    - `methods` are similar to `functions`, but they're defined within the context of a `struct` (or `enum` or a  `trait object`)
    - `methods` first parameter is always `self`
    - All functions defined within an `impl` block are called `associated functions` because theyâ€™re associated with the type named after the `impl`.
    - `Associated functions` don't have self as their first parameter, bc they don't need an instance of the type to work with.
    - `Associated functions` are often used for constructors that will return a new instance of the struct
