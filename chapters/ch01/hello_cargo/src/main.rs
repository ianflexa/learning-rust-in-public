/*
    - rust filanme convention is snake_case eg: learning_rust.rs
    - main function is always the first code that runs
    - we can format our code by doing: rustfmt <file.rs>
    - println! with the "!" calls a rust macro (more in chapter 19).
    - "!" means calling a macro
    - compiling: rustc <file.rs>
    - we can use `cargo build` to build the entering project, and cargo run
    - `cargo check` checks if the code will compile (faster than `cargo build`)
