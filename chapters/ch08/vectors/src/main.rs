/*
    - Vectors allow you to store multiple values in a single data structure next to each other in memory.
    - Vectors can only store values that are the same type.
    - When use `enum` in a `V<T>`, Rust needs to know what types will be in the vector at compile time so it knows exactly how much memory on the heap will be needed to store each element.
